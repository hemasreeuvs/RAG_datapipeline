 Langchain Intro

LangChain serves as the primary "operating system" or toolkit for building these RAG systems. It provides a modular library of "LEGO-like" components—such as document loaders, text splitters, and vector store connectors—that simplify the complex plumbing required to link an LLM to external data. Instead of developers manually coding every step of the retrieval process, LangChain allows them to create "chains" that automate the flow of information from ingestion to the final generated answer. 
The synergy between the two lies in how LangChain orchestrates the RAG pipeline. Using LangChain, a developer can quickly load diverse data formats like PDFs or website content, break them into manageable chunks, and store them as mathematical "embeddings" in a vector database for rapid searching. When a user asks a question, LangChain's retrieval modules find the most relevant pieces of information and prompt the LLM to use that specific data to craft a factually grounded and contextually correct response.
